Real-Time 2D Multiplayer Game Development Plan (SvelteKit & Firebase)
This plan is updated to utilize Svelte 5 Runes for highly efficient and intuitive reactive state management. This approach ensures your cousin masters each piece before tackling the next.
Introduction: Why This Stack?
SvelteKit (The Frontend, Svelte 5): Svelte 5 introduces Runes ($state, $effect, $derived), which use a signal-based approach to reactivity. This makes game development cleaner by letting us declare reactive variables using $state() that update automatically, simplifying the game loop logic.
Firebase (The Backend): Firebase handles user authentication (sign-in) and the database (Firestore), eliminating the need to write and manage a complex custom server. This dramatically speeds up development.
Phase 1: Foundation Setup (SvelteKit & Firebase Project)
Step 1: Initialize the SvelteKit Project
Create the project: Open the terminal and run the standard SvelteKit initialization command.
npm create svelte@latest my-2d-game
# Choose: SvelteKit Demo App, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier (recommended)
cd my-2d-game
npm install



Enable Runes: Ensure Svelte 5 runes are enabled in your svelte.config.js or tsconfig.json (often the default with new installs, but good to check).
Install Firebase:
npm install firebase



Step 2: Set up Firebase Project
Create Project: Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.
Web App Config: Add a web app to the project and copy the configuration object (the apiKey, authDomain, etc.).
Initialize Firebase: Create a file, for example, src/lib/firebase.ts, to initialize the app and export services.

Step 3: Implement Basic Authentication (Using $state)
The game needs to know who the player is to save and sync data.
Enable Auth: In the Firebase Console, enable "Email/Password" or "Google" authentication.
Svelte Reactive Auth State: Create a reactive user state using $state() within a component or dedicated .svelte.ts file. This replaces the need for custom readable stores.
// Example: src/lib/auth.svelte.ts (Must use .svelte.ts extension for $state outside components)
import { onAuthStateChanged, type User } from 'firebase/auth';
import { auth } from './firebase'; // Assume you export 'auth' instance here

// Reactive state object for the current user
export const user = $state<User | null>(null);

// Run this function once, e.g., in the root +layout.svelte
export function initializeAuthListener() {
    onAuthStateChanged(auth, (currentUser) => {
        // Directly update the $state variable, making all consumers reactive
        user = currentUser;
    });
}


Phase 2: Single-Player Core (Canvas & Game Loop)
This phase focuses on getting the game running locally on the canvas, without any network logic.
Step 1: Create the Canvas Component
Create a Svelte component (src/routes/game/+page.svelte) that contains the <canvas> element.
Step 2: Implement the Game Loop ($effect.root and requestAnimationFrame)
The game loop still uses requestAnimationFrame, but we'll use $effect.root to manage the lifecycle of the loop, ensuring it runs once when the component mounts and stops when it unmounts.
Define Reactive Game State: Use $state for player position and other properties that will be updated every frame.
// Inside +page.svelte <script>
let localPlayer = $state({ x: 100, y: 100, speed: 500 });


The Loop Function: The function itself remains vanilla JS, but it updates the Svelte 5 $state variables.
Example simplified logic inside the Svelte component's <script> block:
import { onMount, onDestroy, $effect } from 'svelte';
// Define reactive state for the game (e.g., player position)
let localPlayer = $state({ x: 100, y: 100, speed: 500 });
let isGameRunning = $state(false);

// Global variables for the loop
let lastTime = 0;
let ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D;
let canvas: HTMLCanvasElement;

function updateGame(deltaSeconds: number) {
    // Example update logic using the state
    localPlayer.x += localPlayer.speed * deltaSeconds;
}

function drawGame() {
    if (!ctx) return;
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    // Draw the player (now reactive)
    ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
    ctx.fillRect(localPlayer.x, localPlayer.y, 20, 20);
}

function gameLoop(time: number) {
    if (!isGameRunning) return;

    const delta = time - lastTime;
    lastTime = time;

    // --- 1. UPDATE STATE ---
    updateGame(delta / 1000); // Pass delta in seconds

    // --- 2. RENDER ---
    drawGame();

    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}

$effect.root(() => {
    // This is equivalent to onMount/onDestroy lifecycle in Svelte 5
    const canvasElement = document.getElementById('game-canvas') as HTMLCanvasElement;
    if (canvasElement) {
        canvas = canvasElement;
        ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')!;
        isGameRunning = true;
        lastTime = performance.now();
        requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
    }

    return () => {
        // Cleanup function runs on component destroy
        isGameRunning = false;
    };
});

Step 3: Local Game State (Svelte 5 $state)
The old recommendation to use writable stores for local player state is replaced by the $state() rune, which provides fine-grained reactivity and simpler syntax. Updates happen by simply reassigning the property: localPlayer.x += 10.
Phase 3: Multiplayer Data Model & Real-Time Sync
This is where the magic happens. We will use Cloud Firestore to store the game's shared state and onSnapshot to listen for changes.
Step 1: Firestore Data Structure
The most efficient way to store game state is to create a dedicated collection for games.
Collection: games
Document (Game Room ID): {gameId: string} (e.g., G7hA8k). This document holds the state of one running game.
Field 1: status (string): waiting, in_progress, finished.
Field 2: players (Map/Object): An object where the keys are the Firebase User IDs (uid) and the values are their specific game data.
Player Key (UID)
Data (Position, Health, Input)
uid_player_a
{ x: 100, y: 50, score: 0, lastInput: 'right' }
uid_player_b
{ x: 250, y: 150, score: 5, lastInput: 'down' }

Step 2: Listening for Remote Changes (onSnapshot and $state)
We use Firebase's onSnapshot to listen for remote changes and pipe that data directly into a local $state variable.
Define Shared State: Define a $state object to hold the entire remote game state.
let remoteGameState = $state<GameData | null>(null);


Attach Listener with $effect: Use $effect to manage the onSnapshot listener's lifecycle. $effect runs automatically when its dependencies change, and its return function is the cleanup/unsubscribe function.
import { doc, onSnapshot, getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';
import { db } from '$lib/firebase'; // Firestore instance

let gameId = $state('G7hA8k'); // Reactive game ID

$effect(() => {
    // If the gameId changes, this effect automatically reruns (and cleans up the old listener)
    if (!gameId) return;

    const gameRef = doc(db, "games", gameId);

    // Attach the real-time listener
    const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(gameRef, (docSnapshot) => {
        if (docSnapshot.exists()) {
            remoteGameState = docSnapshot.data() as GameData;
        } else {
            remoteGameState = null;
        }
    });

    // The return function acts as the onDestroy/cleanup
    return () => unsubscribe();
});

Step 3: Writing Player Input
The write function remains the same, as Firebase API calls are standard JavaScript promises.
Write Function: Use updateDoc to write only the local player's specific fields, like their lastInput or targetPosition.
import { doc, updateDoc } from 'firebase/firestore';
// ... when 'right' key is pressed
const playerRef = doc(db, "games", gameId);
await updateDoc(playerRef, {
    [`players.${userId}.lastInput`]: 'right',
    [`players.${userId}.timestamp`]: Date.now() // Important for synchronization!
});



Phase 4: Synchronization and Latency (Advanced Concepts)
For a real-time game, latency is the biggest challenge. Firestore updates take time.
Step 1: Client-Side Prediction (The Illusion of Speed)
Immediate Local Update: When the local player presses a key, immediately update their $state variable (e.g., localPlayer.x += 10). This makes the game feel responsive.
Send Input to Server: Simultaneously, write the input to Firestore (as described in Phase 3, Step 3).
Correcting Jitter: When the onSnapshot update arrives, it contains the official position of your player. Your game loop should use this official position to correct the local player's $state position if they have drifted too far.
Step 2: Managing Other Players
For remote players, always use the position data received from the onSnapshot updates (remoteGameState). If the position updates are jumpy, implement interpolation inside the drawGame loop:
Instead of immediately drawing the remote player at their new received  coordinate, store the new coordinate as their "target" within your local game state.
In your drawGame loop, move the remote player gradually toward that target coordinate each frame. This smooths out the network jitter.
Phase 5: Security and Deployment
Step 1: Firebase Security Rules (CRITICAL)
If you skip this, anyone could write malicious data to your database, ruining the game.
Goal: Only logged-in users can read game rooms, and a player can only write to their own data within a game room document.
Rules Example (Simplified):
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allows a logged-in user to read any game document
    match /games/{gameId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;

      // Allows a player to update their OWN data inside the 'players' map
      allow update: if request.auth != null && request.resource.data.players[request.auth.uid] != null;
    }
  }
}

Step 2: Deployment
SvelteKit is easily deployed to platforms that support serverless functions. Since you are already using Firebase, the simplest path is Firebase Hosting.
